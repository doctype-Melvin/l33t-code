# Leetcode challenges
In this repository I save all my solutions
to leetcode challenges
As of April 2025 I am going through:
* SQL50  
* 30 Days of JavaScript

## Why am I doing this?
I started out learning web development in 2020 and
just recently (2024) got a taste of data analysis and data wrangling
that caused a web dev hiatus. 
To get back into JS and improve my problem solving skills,
I decided to work on SQL and JS problems in parallel. Given that
I find data analysis quite engaging, there are plans to aquire
Python skills for the remainder of the year (2025).
